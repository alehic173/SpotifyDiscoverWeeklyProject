# SpotifyWeeklyReleaseProject


The purpose of this project is to save the songs in the "Discover Weekly" playlist that spotify provides each week. Every week this playlist is updated, and the user loses access to the previous weeks' songs. Adding those songs to a different playlist each week will prevent this.
